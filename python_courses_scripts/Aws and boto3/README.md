## Automating AWS infrastructures with Python & Boto3

### In this directory, we are going to show you how to use Boto3 module to achieve AWS tasks.
#### For the purpose, we choose to work with 4 major AWS services: SQS, EC2, S3 and IAM.

* **sqs_boto3_test.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Simple Queue Services (SQS).
* **ec2_boto3_test.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
* **s3_boto3_test.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
* **Iam_boto3_test.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Install Boto3 module on Python
